## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox


### What I learned


- I learnt about the nth child selector. I initially wanted to give the paragraph tag a class but found a better way of selecting the element after making some google searches. See the snippet below:

```css
p:nth-child(1) {
    font-size: 20px;
    font-weight: bolder;

    color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}

p:nth-child(2) {
    color: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    font-size: 14px;
    font-weight: 400;
}
```

- I got a refresher on how to add external fonts to your html code.

- I gained an insight on proper workflow of developing a website which was completely horrendous prior to this project.

- I had some difficutly setting the content to the center but I then realized it was because I forgot to add a height.

### Continued development

- I used pure CSS on this project and I would like to know wheter Sass is really necessary to learn

- I'm very comfortable with flexbox but I'm not quite confident using grid yet. I don't think I could have used it for this layout though but that's something I definitely want to get better at. Is there a way to distinguish when to use flexbox or grid ?
